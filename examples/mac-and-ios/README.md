# IMBlocks - Mac and iOS examples

This directory contains an Xcode project for compiling and running the blocks library on Mac and iOS devices.

NOTE: iOS build currently broken (can be fixed by removing the DearIMGUI dependecies).

These examples use Metal for the GPU backend. See the files in the Shared directory if you're curious about how the Metal backend is set up.
